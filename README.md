Baby's First Repository
New to coding, trying to teach myself as much as I can, but I do happen to have a really amazing tutor. 
Hobbies include; learning to code, hanging with my favorite person, being a mom, running, writing, cooking, baking, music, tattoos, beer, whiskey, movies, talking smack, tarot, eating tacos, and smashing the patriarchy whenever possible.
