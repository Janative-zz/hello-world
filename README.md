## A Poem 
You were born to be a rainstorm:umbrella:,<br> 
To send your voice throughout the night,<br>
To sing your song with falling raindrops:droplet:,<br>
To break the darkness with your light:sparkles:,<br>
You were born to show raw beauty,<br>
To wash the dirt out from their eyes,<br>
But the whole world ran for cover,<br> 
When you opened up your skies:zap:,<br>
So you made your thunder silent,<br> 
And learned to bite your rainy tongue,<br>
You gave them what they thought they wanted,<br>
You gave them life with endless sun:sunny:,<br>
But as they watched their lives grow weaker,<br> 
Watched as their leaves turned brown and dry:fallen_leaf:,<br>
They wished they didn't take for granted,<br>
Your booming presence in the sky,<br>
You were born to be a rainstorm,<br> 
To be chaotic and be bold:muscle:,<br>
To show there's beauty in the knowledge,<br>
That you cannot be controlled,<br>
Because you might think you're not needed,<br>
Life without you is the same,<br>
But nothing beautiful would ever grow:hibiscus:,<br>
If it was not washed with rain:droplet:.</br>
